  <p>
    <strong>Computing –</strong> I am proficient in various GIS, Remote Sensing, Photogrammetry, and drone image processing solutions such as ArcGIS
    for Desktop Suite, ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Enterprise, QGIS, Mango Online, ERDAS Imagine and pix4DMapper. During my relevant work experience
    I have also acquired diverse IT skills, many self-taught. For example, at Support Systems Limited, I taught myself python.
    My other bank of skills includes: Beginner proficiency of the web design languages/scripting languages in HTML5 and CSS3,
    Bootstrap Framework, Javascript, JQuery, Python and Django framework.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Leadership and Teamwork –</strong> At Support systems, I worked with the GIS team to proffer GIS solution to Eko Distribution Company and played a major role
    in acquiring satellite imagery to be used for geographic phenomenon modeling in this project. I worked with a team to develop a workflow diagram
    to be used in understanding the needs of a potential client. I played a major role in constructing the workflow and offering advisory role on content
    to be included on the workflow. As team leader of a group work in the university, I played a major role in organizing and coordinating team members
    and making sure assignment was submitted at the due time.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Communication –</strong> I have gained better communication skills during my degree course from giving presentations to participation in
    group work. At Support Systems Limited, I liaised with colleagues in my department, the senior management team, and staffs in general. I also served
    under the national Youth Service Corps scheme and it has also helped hone my communication skill while passing across knowledge to students.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Problem Solving –</strong> I studied a degree which incorporates problem conceptualization, research and analysis and requires analytical, numerical,
    and problem-solving skills. I further developed these skills during my Internship where I worked closely with the development team and GIS
    team in proffering solution to client’s need.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Working under pressure and tight time schedule –</strong> Working with the development team has afforded me the opportunity of working under
    pressure and meeting deadlines.
